1.	Standard Turnips

You are a farm worker driving a turnip-harvesting machine. You are approaching two diverging paths. By choosing the path on the left you will harvest ten bushels of turnips. By choosing the path on the right you will harvest twenty bushels of turnips. If you do nothing your turnip-harvesting machine will turn to the left.
Would you turn your turnip-picking machine to the right in order to harvest twenty bushels of turnips instead of ten?

2.	Plant Transport

You are bringing home a number of plants from a store that is about two miles from your home. The trunk of your car, which you’ve lined with plastic to catch the mud from the plants, will hold most of the plants you’ve purchased.

You could bring all the plants home in one trip, but this would require putting some of the plants in the back seat as well as in the trunk. By putting some of the plants in the back seat you will ruin your fine leather upholstery which would cost thousands of dollars to replace.

Would you make two trips home in order to avoid ruining the upholstery of your car?

3.	Scheduling

You are in charge of scheduling appointments in a dentist’s office. Two people, Mr. Morris and Mrs. Santiago have called to make appointments for next Monday. The only available times for next Monday are at 10:00 AM and at 3:00 PM.

Mr. Morris’s schedule is rather flexible. He can have his appointment either at 10:00 AM or at 3:00 PM. Mrs. Santiago’s schedule is less flexible. She can only have her appointment at 10:00 AM.

Would you schedule Mr. Morris for 3:00 PM so that both he and Mrs. Santiago can have their appointments next Monday?

4.	Generic Brand

You have a headache. You go to the pharmacy with the intention of buying a particular name-brand headache medicine. When you get there you discover that the pharmacy is out of the brand you were looking for.

The pharmacist, whom you’ve known for a long time and in whom you have a great deal of trust, tells you that he has in stock a generic product which is, in his words, “exactly the same” as the product you had originally intended to buy.
 
Would you purchase the generic brand instead of searching further for the name-brand product you were looking for?

5.	Brownies

You have decided to make a batch of brownies for yourself. You open your recipe book and find a recipe for brownies.

Would you use your old computer for a few more weeks in order to save $500 on the purchase of a new computer?

A representative of a reputable, national survey organization calls you at your home while you are having a quiet dinner by yourself.

One of these coupons gives you 30% off of your purchase price. This coupon expires tomorrow. The other coupon gives you 25% off your purchase price, and this coupon does not expire for another year.

Would you use the 30%-off coupon for your present purchase so that you will have another coupon to use during the coming year?

10.	Scenic Route

An old friend has invited you to spend the weekend with him at his summer home some ways up the coast from where you are. You intend to travel there by car, and there are two routes that you can take: the highway and the coastal road.

The highway will get you to your friend’s house in about three hours, but the scenery along the highway is very boring. The coastal route will get you to your friend’s house in about three hours and fifteen minutes, and the scenery along the coastal road is breathtakingly beautiful.

Would you take the coastal route in order to observe the beautiful scenery as you drive?

By choosing the path on the left you will harvest thirty bushels of turnips. By choosing the path on the right you will harvest fifteen bushels of turnips. If you do nothing your turnip-picking machine will turn to the left.

12.	Investment Offer

You are at home one day when the mail arrives. You receive a letter from a reputable corporation that provides financial services. They have invited you to invest in a mutual fund, beginning with an initial investment of one thousand dollars.

As it happens, you are familiar with this particular mutual fund. It has not performed very well over the past few years, and, based on what you know, there is no reason to think that it will perform any better in the future.

Would you invest a thousand dollars in this mutual fund in order to make money?

You have brought your broken VCR to the local repair shop. The woman working at the shop tells you that it will cost you about $100 to have it fixed.

You noticed in the paper that morning that the electronics shop next door is having a sale on VCR’s and that a certain new VCR which is slightly better than your old one is on sale for $100.

Would you have your old VCR fixed in order to avoid spending money on a new one?

14.	Choosing Classes

You are beginning your senior year of college. In order to fulfill your graduation requirements you need to take a history class and a science class by the end of the year.

During the fall term, the history class you want to take is scheduled at the same time as the science class you want to take. During the spring term the same history class is offered, but the science class is not.

Would you take the history class during the fall term in order to help you fulfill your graduation requirements?

/**/

15.	Raffle

You’ve decided to buy a raffle ticket to support a local charity. They are separately raffling off two different cars: Car A and Car B. You have decided to buy one raffle ticket. You are a serious and knowledgeable car enthusiast, and you think that these two cars are equally good.

Because there have been a lot of adds for Car B on TV recently, many more people have chosen to buy tickets for the Car B raffle. Since more people have bought tickets for the Car B raffle, your chances of winning are better in the Car A raffle than in the Car B raffle.

Would you buy a ticket for the Car B raffle in order to win a car?

16.	Jogging

You intend to accomplish two things this afternoon: going for a jog and doing some paperwork. In general you prefer to get your work done before you exercise.

The weather is nice at the moment, but the weather forecast says that in a couple of hours it will start to rain. You very much dislike jogging in the rain, but you don’t care what the weather is like while you do paperwork.

At the moment you have a slight urge to cut vegetables. If you first start the water boiling and then cut the vegetables you will be done in twenty minutes. If you cut the vegetables and then start the water boiling you will be done in forty minutes.

Would you cut the vegetables first and then start the water boiling in order to satisfy your slight urge to cut vegetables?

/**/

18.	Shower

You are planning to attend a luncheon this afternoon, and before you go you will need to take a shower. You have some yard work that you would like to do before then, and doing this yard will cause you to perspire a fair amount.

If you shower before you do your yard work you will have to take another shower before the luncheon. At the present time you could enjoy taking a shower. At the same time, you have a very strong commitment to lowering your water bill and to showering no more than once a day.
